          Fender Stratocaster

        <p class="article-content">
          This is my Fender Stratocaster.  It has lasers.  It literally shoots lasers at Republicans.  I'm not joking.  As you can see it's totally badass.  It's sunglasses are not pictured as they're being repaired by the International Space Laboratory.  Even more amazing than all that is the fact that this guitar is a eunuch.  No penis.  Rock on.

              Oh my god.  Holy lord.  This thing was with me when I played before Ted Cruz at the Republican National Convention.  Ted Cruz was caught looking at porn on Twitter the other day.  That's why I've named this guitar "Lyin' Ted."  It was filmed during the infamous 90s porn flick "Hollywood Hot Tubs" in the scene where a truck driver slams into a police barricade and pirahnas burst out of every orifice in the earth.
